// Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM role.
 When you embed an inline policy in a role, the inline policy is used as part of the role's access (permissions) policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using [CreateRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreateRole.html). You can update a role's trust policy using [UpdateAssumeRolePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssumeRolePolicy.html). For information about roles, see [roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
 A role can also have a managed policy attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a role, use [AWS::IAM::Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-role.html). To create a new managed policy, use [AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-managedpolicy.html). For information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
 For information about the maximum number of inline policies that you can embed with a role, see [IAM and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
