package replicationgroup

#Properties: {
	// A flag that enables encryption at rest when set to true.AtRestEncryptionEnabled after the replication group is created. To enable encryption at rest on a replication group you must set AtRestEncryptionEnabled to true when you create the replication group.
	AtRestEncryptionEnabled?: bool
	// Reserved parameter. The password used to access a password protected server.AuthToken can be specified only on replication groups where TransitEncryptionEnabled is true. For more information.
	AuthToken?: string
	// This parameter is currently disabled.
	AutoMinorVersionUpgrade?: bool
	// Specifies whether a read-only replica is automatically promoted to read/write primary if the existing primary fails. AutomaticFailoverEnabled must be enabled for Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication groups.
	AutomaticFailoverEnabled?: bool
	// The compute and memory capacity of the nodes in the node group (shard).
	CacheNodeType?: string

	NotificationTopicArn?: string
	// The number of clusters this replication group initially has.This parameter is not used if there is more than one node group (shard). You should use ReplicasPerNodeGroup instead.
	NumCacheClusters?: int

	PreferredCacheClusterAZs?: [...string]
	// Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on the cluster is performed. It is specified as a range in the format ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The minimum maintenance window is a 60 minute period.
	PreferredMaintenanceWindow?: string
	// The identifier of the cluster that serves as the primary for this replication group. This cluster must already exist and have a status of available.
	PrimaryClusterId?: string
	// An optional parameter that specifies the number of replica nodes in each node group (shard). Valid values are 0 to 5.
	// **Note:** Using ReplicasPerNodeGroup with NodeGroupConfiguration results in resource replacement. For online scaling, use ReplicasPerNodeGroup alone.
	ReplicasPerNodeGroup?: int
	// A user-created description for the replication group.
	ReplicationGroupDescription: string
	// The replication group identifier. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

	Tags?: [...#Tag]
	// A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to true.
	TransitEncryptionEnabled?: bool
	// A setting that allows you to migrate your clients to use in-transit encryption, with no downtime. When setting TransitEncryptionEnabled to true, you can set your TransitEncryptionMode to preferred in the same request, to allow both encrypted and unencrypted connections at the same time. Once you migrate all your Redis OSS clients to use encrypted connections you can modify the value to required to allow encrypted connections only. Setting TransitEncryptionMode to required is a two-step process that requires you to first set the TransitEncryptionMode to preferred, after that you can set TransitEncryptionMode to required. This process will not trigger the replacement of the replication group.
