package configrule

#Properties: {
	// A name for the CC rule. If you don't specify a name, CFN generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the rule name. For more information, see [Name Type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-name.html).
	ConfigRuleName?: string
	// The description that you provide for the CC rule.
	Description?: string
	// The modes the CC rule can be evaluated in. The valid values are distinct objects. By default, the value is Detective evaluation mode only.
	EvaluationModes?: [...#EvaluationModeConfiguration]
	// A string, in JSON format, that is passed to the CC rule Lambda function.
	InputParameters?: string
	// The maximum frequency with which CC runs evaluations for a rule. You can specify a value for ``MaximumExecutionFrequency`` when:
  +  You are using an AWS managed rule that is triggered at a periodic frequency.
  +  Your custom rule is triggered when CC delivers the configuration snapshot. For more information, see [ConfigSnapshotDeliveryProperties](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_ConfigSnapshotDeliveryProperties.html).
  
  By default, rules with a periodic trigger are evaluated every 24 hours. To change the frequency, specify a valid value for the ``MaximumExecutionFrequency`` parameter.
	MaximumExecutionFrequency?: string
	// Defines which resources can trigger an evaluation for the rule. The scope can include one or more resource types, a combination of one resource type and one resource ID, or a combination of a tag key and value. Specify a scope to constrain the resources that can trigger an evaluation for the rule. If you do not specify a scope, evaluations are triggered when any resource in the recording group changes.
  The scope can be empty.
	Scope?: #Scope
	// Provides the rule owner (```` for managed rules, ``CUSTOM_POLICY`` for Custom Policy rules, and ``CUSTOM_LAMBDA`` for Custom Lambda rules), the rule identifier, and the notifications that cause the function to evaluate your AWS resources.
	Source: #Source
}

#CustomPolicyDetails: {
	// The boolean expression for enabling debug logging for your CC Custom Policy rule. The default value is ``false``.
	EnableDebugLogDelivery?: bool
	// The runtime system for your CC Custom Policy rule. Guard is a policy-as-code language that allows you to write policies that are enforced by CC Custom Policy rules. For more information about Guard, see the [Guard GitHub Repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard).
	PolicyRuntime?: string
	// The policy definition containing the logic for your CC Custom Policy rule.
	PolicyText?: string
}

#EvaluationModeConfiguration: {
	// The mode of an evaluation. The valid values are Detective or Proactive.
	Mode?: string
}

#Scope: {
	// The ID of the only AWS resource that you want to trigger an evaluation for the rule. If you specify a resource ID, you must specify one resource type for ``ComplianceResourceTypes``.
	ComplianceResourceId?: string
	// The resource types of only those AWS resources that you want to trigger an evaluation for the rule. You can only specify one type if you also specify a resource ID for ``ComplianceResourceId``.
	ComplianceResourceTypes?: [...string]
	// The tag key that is applied to only those AWS resources that you want to trigger an evaluation for the rule.
	TagKey?: string
	// The tag value applied to only those AWS resources that you want to trigger an evaluation for the rule. If you specify a value for ``TagValue``, you must also specify a value for ``TagKey``.
	TagValue?: string
}

#Source: {
	// Provides the runtime system, policy definition, and whether debug logging is enabled. Required when owner is set to ``CUSTOM_POLICY``.
	CustomPolicyDetails?: #CustomPolicyDetails
	// Indicates whether AWS or the customer owns and manages the CC rule.
  CC Managed Rules are predefined rules owned by AWS. For more information, see [Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_use-managed-rules.html) in the *developer guide*.
  CC Custom Rules are rules that you can develop either with Guard (``CUSTOM_POLICY``) or LAMlong (``CUSTOM_LAMBDA``). For more information, see [Custom Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_develop-rules.html) in the *developer guide*.
	Owner: string
	// Provides the source and the message types that cause CC to evaluate your AWS resources against a rule. It also provides the frequency with which you want CC to run evaluations for the rule if the trigger type is periodic.
 If the owner is set to ``CUSTOM_POLICY``, the only acceptable values for the CC rule trigger message type are ``ConfigurationItemChangeNotification`` and ``OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification``.
	SourceDetails?: [...#SourceDetail]
	// For CC Managed rules, a predefined identifier from a list. For example, ``IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY`` is a managed rule. To reference a managed rule, see [List of Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html).
 For CC Custom Lambda rules, the identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule's LAMlong function, such as ``arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:custom_rule_name``.
 For CC Custom Policy rules, this field will be ignored.
	SourceIdentifier?: string
}

#SourceDetail: {
	// The source of the event, such as an AWS service, that triggers CC to evaluate your AWS resources.
	EventSource: string
	// The frequency at which you want CC to run evaluations for a custom rule with a periodic trigger. If you specify a value for ``MaximumExecutionFrequency``, then ``MessageType`` must use the ``ScheduledNotification`` value.
  By default, rules with a periodic trigger are evaluated every 24 hours. To change the frequency, specify a valid value for the ``MaximumExecutionFrequency`` parameter.
 Based on the valid value you choose, CC runs evaluations once for each valid value. For example, if you choose ``Three_Hours``, CC runs evaluations once every three hours. In this case, ``Three_Hours`` is the frequency of this rule.
	MaximumExecutionFrequency?: string
	// The type of notification that triggers CC to run an evaluation for a rule. You can specify the following notification types:
  +   ``ConfigurationItemChangeNotification`` - Triggers an evaluation when CC delivers a configuration item as a result of a resource change.
  +   ``OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification`` - Triggers an evaluation when CC delivers an oversized configuration item. CC may generate this notification type when a resource changes and the notification exceeds the maximum size allowed by Amazon SNS.
  +   ``ScheduledNotification`` - Triggers a periodic evaluation at the frequency specified for ``MaximumExecutionFrequency``.
  +   ``ConfigurationSnapshotDeliveryCompleted`` - Triggers a periodic evaluation when CC delivers a configuration snapshot.
  
 If you want your custom rule to be triggered by configuration changes, specify two SourceDetail objects, one for ``ConfigurationItemChangeNotification`` and one for ``OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification``.
	MessageType: string
