	// Specifies whether a rule is the last to be applied with respect to a finding that matches the rule criteria. This is useful when a finding matches the criteria for multiple rules, and each rule has different actions. If a rule is terminal, Security Hub CSPM applies the rule action to a finding that matches the rule criteria and doesn't evaluate other rules for the finding. By default, a rule isn't terminal.
