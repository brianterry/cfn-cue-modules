	// A description of the origin access control.
	Description?: string
	// A name to identify the origin access control. You can specify up to 64 characters.
	Name: string
	// The type of origin that this origin access control is for.
	OriginAccessControlOriginType: string & =~"^(s3|mediastore|lambda|mediapackagev2)$"
	// Specifies which requests CloudFront signs (adds authentication information to). Specify ``always`` for the most common use case. For more information, see [origin access control advanced settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html#oac-advanced-settings) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
	// This field can have one of the following values:
	// +  ``always`` – CloudFront signs all origin requests, overwriting the ``Authorization`` header from the viewer request if one exists.
	// +  ``never`` – CloudFront doesn't sign any origin requests. This value turns off origin access control for all origins in all distributions that use this origin access control.
	// +  ``no-override`` – If the viewer request doesn't contain the ``Authorization`` header, then CloudFront signs the origin request. If the viewer request contains the ``Authorization`` header, then CloudFront doesn't sign the origin request and instead passes along the ``Authorization`` header from the viewer request. *WARNING: To pass along the Authorization header from the viewer request, you must add the Authorization header to a cache policy for all cache behaviors that use origins associated with this origin access control.*
	SigningBehavior: string & =~"^(never|no-override|always)$"
	// The signing protocol of the origin access control, which determines how CloudFront signs (authenticates) requests. The only valid value is ``sigv4``.
	SigningProtocol: string & =~"^(sigv4)$"
